## ðŸš€ Proposal <a name="id01"></a>
This repository was developed by Solis Tecnologia to provide a practical and challenging experience for students and teachers. Encourage:

- Analyze the SoBot Robotic Station as an innovative learning platform.
- Identify and apply theories and practical experiments using the SoBot tool.
- Use the SoBot Robot and its accessories in practical tasks, optimizing educational applications.
- Explore courses and experiments focused on robotics to develop technical skills.

Through this repository, participants will solve problems using Sobot, while learning how to use Gihutb to share their solutions with the community.

## ðŸ’¡ Structure of the Challenges <a name="id02"></a>
This repository is organized to facilitate navigation and contributions from students and teachers. Each challenge has its own folder in the repository's root directory, containing all related files. The structure follows this pattern:

```
ðŸ“‚challenges 
    ðŸ“„ Challenge_001.md                        
    ðŸ“„ Challenge_002.md                        
    ðŸ“„ Challenge_003.md
