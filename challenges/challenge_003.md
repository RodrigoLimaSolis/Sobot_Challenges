# Challenge 003 - SOBOT MAGNETO
## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Description
In this challenge, participants will explore the Electromagnet Module integrated with the Fork Lift Module, allowing the SoBot to manipulate metallic objects. This includes assembling the module, controlling the electromagnet's functionality, and developing programming logic to simulate logistics picking system.

### Basic

With the lift module installed on the SoBotâ€™s top cover, assemble the Magneto Module following the instructions in our [YouTube](https://youtu.be/XTq0hs1Pg6g?list=PLJpodHj3AF0-VNTDBlsqiOu7pw9HkQsv-&t=340) and the "APOSTILA SOBOT" (2nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 81).

CAUTION: Perform the electrical wiring for the lift module with the electromagnet as instructed in the "APOSTILA SOBOT" (2nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 82) to avoid electrical issues or damage.
    

### Intermediate
After assembling the lift module with the electromagnet, control its relays (digital output). First, pick up the metal boxes using the electromagnet, then raise and lower the lift, and finally release the boxes.

### Advanced
 1. After mastering the control of the electromagnets, simulate the collection of metal boxes to deposit them on the acrylic shelf provided with the SoBot kit.
