# Challenge 005 - SOBOT Agritech CONTROL

## üéØ Challenge Objective
In this challenge, you will use the Agritech Module to explore assembly concepts, color detection, and simulation of agricultural spraying applications with a focus on computer vision.

### Basic
1. **Assembly of the Agritech Module:**
    Follow the assembly instructions for the Agritech module as provided in our video available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt1ajyvTT6U&list=PLJpodHj3AF0-VNTDBlsqiOu7pw9HkQsv-&index=5) and the ‚ÄúAPOSTILA SOBOT‚Äù (2¬™ Edi√ß√£o ‚Äì 2024, p. 84).

    ATEN√á√ÉO: Ensure the electrical connections of the Agritech module follow the instructions in the ‚ÄúAPOSTILA SOBOT‚Äù (2¬™ Edi√ß√£o ‚Äì 2024, p. 88) to avoid electrical damage.

2. **Programming:**
After assembling the Agritech module, implement a program to activate the tank valves.

### Intermediate
After assembling the Agritech module, develop a program for color recognition using computer vision.

Use the OpenCV library with Python, which comes pre-installed on the SoBot's Raspberry Pi. Numerous tutorials are available online, and there is an example using this library in our GitHub repository.

### Advanced
After completing the Agritech module assembly and programming for color recognition, simulate the application of agricultural sprays using the red and green EVA sheets from the Agritech kit.

The program should be able to count the total and individual occurrences of green and red detected colors, applying the spray only where red is detected.
