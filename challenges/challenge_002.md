# Challenge 002 - SOBOT FORK LIFT

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Objective
In this challenge, participants must assemble and control the **Fork Lift Module** along with the **Line Follower Board** on the SoBot. This includes practicing the assembly, executing commands to control the lift module, and developing efficient programming for the robot to follow a predefined line.

### Basic

1. **Fork Lift Module Assembly:**

    Assemble the fork lift module following instructions from our [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTq0hs1Pg6g&list=PLJpodHj3AF0-VNTDBlsqiOu7pw9HkQsv-&index=4) and the "APOSTILA SOBOT" (2nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 78).

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Perform the electrical wiring for the lift module as instructed in the "APOSTILA SOBOT" (2nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 79) to avoid electrical issues or damage.

2. **Programming:**
   After assembling the lift module, program it to perform lifting and lowering movements.



### Intermediate
1. **Line Follower Sensor Board Assembly:**
    Assemble the Line Follower Sensor Board following instructions from our [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owvi0FTPSAM&list=PLJpodHj3AF0-VNTDBlsqiOu7pw9HkQsv-&index=3) and the "APOSTILA SOBOT" (2nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 75).

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Perform the electrical wiring for the Line Follower Sensor Board as instructed in the "APOSTILA SOBOT" (2nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 77) to avoid electrical issues or damage.

**2. Programming:**
   After assembling the Line Follower Sensor Board, draw a straight line on the floor with electrical tape and program the SoBot to follow the line.



### Advanced
 1. After assembling the fork lift module and the Line Follower Sensor Board, use the line drawn in the previous step. At both the start and end points, place a marker for one of the edge sensors to identify. Program the robot to pick up a pallet with boxes, carry it to the end of the line, deposit the pallet, and return to the starting point.
