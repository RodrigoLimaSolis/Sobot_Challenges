# Challenge 002 - SOBOT FORK LIFT

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Objective
The goal of this challenge is to assemble and control the **Forklift Module** together with the **Line Follower Board** on the SoBot. This includes practicing assembly, executing commands to control the lifting module, and developing efficient programming for the robot to follow a predefined line.

### Basic

1. **Fork Lift Module Assembly:**

    Assemble the fork lift module following instructions in our video available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTq0hs1Pg6g&list=PLJpodHj3AF0-VNTDBlsqiOu7pw9HkQsv-&index=4) and in the "SOBOT HANDBOOK" (3nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 78).

    CAUTION: Perform the electrical wiring for the lift module as instructed in the "SOBOT HANDBOOK" (3nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 79) to avoid electrical issues or damage.

**2. Programming:**
   After assembling the lift module, program it to perform the up and down movement.



### Intermediate
1. **Line Follower Sensor Board Assembly:**
    Assemble the Line Follower Sensor Board following instructions in our video available on[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owvi0FTPSAM&list=PLJpodHj3AF0-VNTDBlsqiOu7pw9HkQsv-&index=3) and in the "SOBOT HANDBOOK" (3nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 75).

    CAUTION: Perform the electrical wiring for the Line Follower Sensor Board as instructed in the "SOBOT HANDBOOK" (3nd Edition â€“ 2024, p. 77) to avoid electrical issues or damage.

2. **Programming:**
   After assembling the Line Follower Sensor Board, draw a straight line with insulating tape on the floor and program the SoBot move following the line.



### Advanced
 1. After assembling the fork lift module and the Line Follower Sensor Board, use the line drawn in the previous procedure, placing a tape at the starting point and also at the end point so that one of the sensors at the end can identify it, collect a pallet with boxes and take it to the end of the drawn line to deposit the collected pallet and return to the starting point.
